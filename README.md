# Music Player Sample
A great starting point for a basic music player Android app (from the tutorial - part 3, https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-music-player-on-android-user-controls--mobile-22787) that addresses bugs including, but not limited to:
  * App crashing from a NullPointerException when clicking on a song in the list
  * Granting permissions properly for devices under 6.0 (Marshmallow/API 23) as well as 6.0 and above
  * Controller initially being in a paused state after playing a song
  * Controller showing the position (minute-mark) and duration (song length) as 0s when paused
  * Duplicate controllers stacking on top of each other towards the anchor view
